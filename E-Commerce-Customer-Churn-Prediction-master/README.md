# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning



### The Problem

In the domain of e-commerce, acquiring a new customer is generally more expensive than keeping the existing ones. The customers usually leave if they do not get good incentives. Thus, analyzing customer behavior to predict customer churn and the reasons can be a great solution for businesses especially small businesses and startups to monitor customer behavior and offer a suitable incentive that could help in maintaining the customers. In Saudi Arabia, most of the e-commerce platforms donâ€™t offer an analytics tool for the traders to help them analyze the customer behavior which lead them to close their stores at the end. Therefore, offering a tool that can help them to analyze customer behavior will be a great contribution.

 

### The Goals

* Help small businesses in e-commerce.
